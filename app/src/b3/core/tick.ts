 *
 * The role of the Tick class is to store the instances of tree, debug, target
 * and blackboard. So, all nodes can access these informations.
 *
 * For internal uses, the Tick also is useful to store the open node after the
 * tick signal, in order to let `BehaviorTree` to keep track and close them
 * when necessary.
 *
 * This class also makes a bridge between nodes and the debug, passing the node
 * state to the debug if the last is provided.
