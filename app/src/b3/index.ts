/**
 * Behavior3JS
 * ===========
 *
 * * * *
 *
 * **Behavior3JS** is a Behavior Tree library written in JavaScript. It
 * provides structures and algorithms that assist you in the task of creating
 * intelligent agents for your game or application. Check it out some features
 * of Behavior3JS:
 *
 * - Based on the work of (Marzinotto et al., 2014), in which they propose a
 *   **formal**, **consistent** and **general** definition of Behavior Trees;
 * - **Optimized to control multiple agents**: you can use a single behavior
 *   tree instance to handle hundreds of agents;
 * - It was **designed to load and save trees in a JSON format**, in order to
 *   use, edit and test it in multiple environments, tools and languages;
 * - A **cool visual editor** which you can access online;
 * - Several **composite, decorator and action nodes** available within the
 *   library. You still can define your own nodes, including composites and
 *   decorators;
 * - **Completely free**, the core module and the visual editor are all published
 *   under the MIT License, which means that you can use them for your open source
 *   and commercial projects;
 * - **Lightweight**, only 11.5KB!
 *

 *
 *
 * Core Classes and Functions
 * --------------------------
 *
 * This library include the following core structures...
 *
 * **Public:**
 *
 * - **BehaviorTree**: the structure that represents a Behavior Tree;
 * - **Blackboard**: represents a "memory" in an agent and is required to to
 *   run a `BehaviorTree`;
 * - **Composite**: base class for all composite nodes;
 * - **Decorator**: base class for all decorator nodes;
 * - **Action**: base class for all action nodes;
 * - **Condition**: base class for all condition nodes;
 *
 * **Internal:**
 *
 *
 * - **Tick**: used as container and tracking object through the tree during
 *   the tick signal;
 * - **BaseNode**: the base class that provide all common node features;
 *
 * *Some classes are used internally on Behavior3JS, but you may need to access
 * its functionalities eventually, specially the `Tick` object.*
 *
 *
 * Nodes Included
 * --------------
 *
 * **Composite Nodes**:
 *
 * - Sequence;
 * - Priority;
 * - MemSequence;
 * - MemPriority;
 *
 *
 * **Decorators**:
 *
 * - Inverter;
 * - Limiter
 * - MaxTime;
 * - Repeater;
 * - RepeaterUntilFailure;
 * - RepeaterUntilSuccess;
 *
 *
 * **Actions**:
 *
 * - Succeeder;
 * - Failer;
 * - Error;
 * - Runner;
 * - Wait.

	/**
	 * Class is a meta-factory function to create classes in JavaScript. It is a
	 * shortcut for the CreateJS syntax style. By default, the class created by
	 * this function have an initialize function (the constructor). Optionally,
	 * you can specify the inheritance by passing another class as parameter.
	 *
	 * By default, all classes created using this function, may receive only a
	 * dictionary parameter as argument. This pattern is commonly used by jQuery
	 * and its plugins.
	 *
	 * Since 0.2.0, Class also receives a `properties` parameter, a dictionary
	 * which will be used to fill the new class prototype.
